## Hi, I’m Alessandro! 👋

I’m a **computational neuroscientist** and **AI researcher** passionate about understanding how the brain controls movement and generates behavior. My research combines **deep learning**, **musculoskeletal modeling**, and **neural data analysis** to explore the computational underpinnings of motor control and sensorimotor integration.  

## 🧠 Current Research  
I'm currently a PhD student in the group of Prof. Alexander Mathis ([website](https://mathislab.org/) and [repository](https://github.com/amathislab) ) focusing on:
- **Task-driven neural network models predict neural dynamics of proprioception**  
  We combined deep learning, musculoskeletal modeling and neural data analysis to investigate the integrative logic of proprioception ([paper](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(24)00239-3) and [repository](https://github.com/amathislab/Task-driven-Proprioception)
- **Deep reinforcement learning for musculoskeletal control**  
  We developed a new curriculum learning strategy which combined with latent exploration achieved the first place in the Manipulation track of the Myochallenge 2023 ([paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=3A84lx1JFh), [repository](https://github.com/amathislab/myochallenge-lattice) and [blog](https://medium.com/@myosuite/myochallenge-23-a-retrospect-b15a845e10c3))
